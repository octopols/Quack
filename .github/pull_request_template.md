<!-- Any performance considerations -->
- Memory usage: <!-- Check Chrome Task Manager (Shift+Esc) before/after -->
- CPU impact: <!-- Monitor CPU usage during search operations -->
- Search speed: <!-- Time taken for search completion on large comment sets -->

<!-- ### How to Measure:
1. **Memory**: Open Chrome Task Manager (Shift+Esc), find "Extension: Quack", note memory before/after search
2. **CPU**: Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab or system monitor during active search
3. **Search Speed**: Test on videos with 1k+ comments, measure time from search start to completion -->
